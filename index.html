  <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Website</h1>
  <p>GitHub is a web-based platform used primarily for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to host, manage, and track changes to their code using Git, a powerful version control system. GitHub makes it easy for individuals and teams to work together on projects, share code, and contribute to open-source software. With features like pull requests, issue tracking, code reviews, and integrated CI/CD tools, GitHub has become an essential hub for modern software development. In addition to supporting developers, it also serves as a portfolio platform where users can showcase their work to potential employers or collaborators.</p>
